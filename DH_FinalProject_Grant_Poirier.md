## Absrtact
Archaeology is a very expensive and time consuming field, mainly due to the processes of excavating and analysing the artifacts that are found at a site. Once a prospective excavation site it found, most archaeologists are unable to complete all of the work that they would like to do for their project because of time and money constraints. One excavation site that is commonly revisited by archaeologists is Çatalhӧyük in Turkey. This project will allow its participants to create both a 3D interactive digital model of the excavation site at Çatalhӧyük as it looks today, and 3D interactive digital model of what archaeologists assume the site originally looked like in antiquity. Both Archaeologists and Archaeology students will be able to use these 3D models to study the site and perform new research based on what has already been found at the site at a much cheaper cost than actually traveling to the site. Google SketchUp will be used to create both of these interactive 3D models. In order to make the digital model as descriptive as possible, there will be collaboration between past archaeologists who have worked on the site so that they can provide all of their findings to be added to the digital model. By the end of this project, a 3D digital model of the excavation site at Çatalhӧyük will have been created that will be a virtual replica of the current site and what the site looked like in the past.
