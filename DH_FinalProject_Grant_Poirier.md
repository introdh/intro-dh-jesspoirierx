## Absrtact
Archaeology is a very expensive and time consuming field, mainly due to the processes of excavating and analysing the artifacts that are found at a site. Once a prospective excavation site it found, most archaeologists are unable to complete all of the work that they would like to do for their project because of time and money constraints. One excavation site that is commonly revisited by archaeologists is Çatalhӧyük in Turkey. This project will allow its participants to create both a 3D interactive digital model of the excavation site at Çatalhӧyük as it looks today, and 3D interactive digital model of what archaeologists assume the site originally looked like in antiquity. Both Archaeologists and Archaeology students will be able to use these 3D models to study the site and perform new research based on what has already been found at the site at a much cheaper cost than actually traveling to the site. Google SketchUp will be used to create both of these interactive 3D models. In order to make the digital model as descriptive as possible, there will be collaboration between past archaeologists who have worked on the site so that they can provide all of their findings to be added to the digital model. By the end of this project, a 3D digital model of the excavation site at Çatalhӧyük will have been created that will be a virtual replica of the current site and what the site looked like in the past.

## Narrative
### Enhancing the humanities

I request an National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Humanities Level 1 Start-Up grant to fund the creation of two 3D digital models of the archaeological excavation site at Çatalhӧyük in Turkey. The first of these models will be an exact replica of the site as it looks today. This will not only be a model of the current site, but it will also include interactive points on the map that share information about what was discovered by archaeologists at the site. In order to make the digital model as descriptive as possible, there will be collaboration between past archaeologists who have worked on the site so that they can provide all of their findings to be added to the digital model. These archaeologists will include: James Mellaart, Ian Hodder, and Colin Renfrew. As much information as is available about the site will be added to the project such as: measurements of the site itself, location and description of artifacts found, the temperature of the area the site is located in, what kind of materials make up the ground of the site, etc. To create the model itself, Google SketchUp will used. In addition, ArcGIS will be used to plot points on the 3D map of where specific artifacts were found at the site.

This model will be useful to Classics scholars and students, as well as general audiences in the humanities. Performing archaeological research is expensive a very expensive process, and therefore difficult for most archaeologists to complete. This model will offer a cheaper option for archaeologists because it will offer the same information that can be found at the site itself, but without the costs associated with traveling to a foreign country. This will also be useful for students who want to learn about the process of performing an excavation and recording the information about what was discovered. Students will be able to use this 3D digital model to see how an excavation site is set up and have a first hand look at the importance of performing the steps in an excavation to properly record all of the information. A general audience in the humanities will be able to both use and appreciate the 3D model as a useful tool in the Digital Humanities. The site will include information that is clear and will be understandable for viewers will no background in archaeology or the Classics. The main purpose of performing excavations is to discover information about the past and share that information with the world. This 3D model will be widely accessible, so everyone will have the opportunity to learn about the excavation at Çatalhӧyük in Turkey, as well as archaeology as a whole. 

The second 3D digital model that will be created will be a virtual replica of what archaeologists think Catalhӧyük originally looked like in antiquity. Both historians and tourists appreciate learning about the past and would enjoy seeing a piece of history preserved in modern times. The purpose of creating a 3D model of this replica rather than actually building the replica on top of the site is to preserve the excavation site so that future archaeologists who develop new excavations techniques will have access to the site. Also, there is much debate by Classics scholars about the ethics of restoring the damaged sites from antiquity. Some scholars believe that the process of restoring the site detracts from the importance of learning about the past societies because it imposes a modern view on the ancient site. An example of an excavation site that was restored with modern imagery is the site of Knossos in Crete. This site was excavated by Arthur Evans who decided to restore the palace on the site by adding in new columns and wall frescos. While tourists enjoy seeing this structure, it is misleading because there is no evidence that the design Evans employed in the restoration was what the site actually looked like in antiquity. While it may not be ethical to physically restore a site from the ancient world, there is no reason who archaeologists should not be able to use their knowledge of the site and make inferences about what the site looked like in antiquity to make a 3D digital replica. In order to create this 3D digital model, Google SketchUp will used.

This model will be useful for Classics scholars and students, but will mainly be for the use of people who want to experience the the site at Çatalhӧyük as it was in antiquity. With the model, people will be able to explore Çatalhӧyük and see what modern archaeologists assume the site looked like in antiquity based off of their research. There will be a feature where the viewer can click between the 3D restored replica and the 3D model of the site as it currently stands so they can see how the site survived over time.

### Environmental Scan
There are two notable projects that are similar to the project I am requesting to create, which include the Virtual St. Paul’s Cathedral Project and the University of Cincinnati's Virtual Troy Project. The Virtual St. Paul’s Cathedral Project is similar to the project I would like to create in the sense that a 3D digital model was created of a historical site. The purpose of creating this model was to offer a way for viewers to experience what it was like to attend a sermon in this Cathedral during the height of its use. The creators of this project used Google SketchUp to make the 3D digital model that is interactive, so the same software could be used for the creation of my project. The other project that is similar to the one I am suggesting is he University of Cincinnati's Virtual Troy Project. This project is an interactive website that allows viewers to click through the nine different levels of the site of Troy at Hisarlik Turkey. This website includes information about the artifacts found at all of the different levels of the site during the excavations that were performed there by Heinrich Schliemann. This project serves as an excellent research tool for scholars and students who would like to learn more about why the excavations at Troy were performed, what was found during the excavations, and what information the artifacts found at the site tell modern archaeologists about the site in the past. Both of these projects have previously received grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities. 

While both of these projects include aspects that are similar to the one I propose to create, the 3D digital model of Çatalhӧyük will be slightly different. I will combine the ideas guiding both of these projects to create my models. The 3D models of Çatalhӧyük will look similar to the virtual model of St. Paul’s Cathedral in the sense that the format of the model will be the same, and the same software will be used. The 3D models of Çatalhӧyük will be similar to the Virtual Troy Project in the sense that they will provide information about the excavation site through interactive points on the map. The 3D models of Çatalhӧyük will advance the field of virtual projects in the Classics field by offering a cheaper alternative to visiting the physical site that offers the same amount of information.

### History of the project
This project is still in the beginning phase of the process. The only previous work to this project that has been completed are the excavations that were performed at the site of Çatalhӧyük in Turkey. These excavations will provide the project with the information necessary to create an accurate 3D digital model of the site that includes data of what was discovered at the site and where it was found. If this project received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the money will be used collect the information regarding the excavations at Çatalhӧyük from the archaeologist, as well as to fund the creation of the 3D digital models. 

### Work plan
During the period following the receipt of the grant, workers will be brought in to assist in organizing the data collected from the archaeologists about previous excavations so that it can be added to the 3D digital model. Elizabeth Baughan, Professor of Archaeology at the University of Richmond, will assist in the collection of the data and in the proper organization of the data so that all of the correct information will be properly added to the model. Workers will use ArcGIS to plot points on the map that have interactive links to the data about artifacts that were found at that specific place. Robert K. Nelson, director of the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond, will be in charge of creating both 3D digital models using Google SketchUp. 

The schedule for this project is as follows:
 - Workers will collect the data from the archaeologists about the excavation site and artifacts found at the site.
 
 - Workers will work with Robert K. Nelson to create the 3D digital models based off the data of the excavation site.
 
 - Workers will organize the data about the artifacts found at the site.
 
 - A review process will begin where workers and Elizabeth Baughan ensure the data is organized correctly. 
 
Workers will work with Robert K. Nelson to include the data about the artifacts found at the site in interactive points on the models.

The largest risk in the creation of the 3D digital models is that the information about the excavations at Çatalhӧyük will be entered incorrectly. The whole purpose of the creation of the models is to provide a cheaper option to visiting the site in person that provided just as much information, so it is imperative that all data added to the model is accurate. In order to mitigate these risks, there will be two stages of review of the datas by volunteers, and a final stage of review by Elizabeth Baughan. 

After the completion of the project, students at the University of Richmond will be asked to volunteer to review the 3D models and provide feedback on how effective they are at conveying the information about Çatalhӧyük.

### Staff
Elizabeth Baughan (Professor of Archaeology at the University of Richmond) will serve as an advisor to the project and will also be in charge of the quality control of the data collected from the archaeologists who previously worked at the site of Çatalhӧyük. 

Robert K. Nelson (Director of the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond) will serve as the project manager in charge of creating both the 3D digital models of Çatalhӧyük, as well as overseeing the workers who assist in the creation of the models. 

Jessica Poirier (University of Richmond) will serve as the project director in charge of overseeing the project and making sure the workers stay on schedule, as well as managing the budget. 
All of the staff members will be expected to participate in this project until its completion, which is expected to take 6 months.  

## Final product and dissemination
After both 3D digital models of the site at Çatalhӧyük are completed, I hope that they will be published to the National Endowment for the Humanities website, so that they can be easily accessed by a general audience in the humanities. It is also planned that a website will be created just for the display and use of the 3D digital models. The staff members who work on this project will be asked to write articles about the creation of this project and how their work relates to the digital humanities, which will be published online. In the future, a feature will be added to the 3D models that allows the viewer to hear the data provided read to them, so that those who are visually impaired will also be able to take advantage of the 3D models. Both of the 3D models of Çatalhӧyük that will be created with this project will be free and publicly available.
