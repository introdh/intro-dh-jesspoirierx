   In order to create my georeferenced map of New Haven, CT I used the ArcMap mapping tool to add spatial coordinates to an image of a map. In ArcMap, I added a topographic base map, and then added the map of New Haven from the Mapping Inequality project on top. I then clicked back and forth between the two maps, and added coordinates to line them both up. This allowed me to correctly align the Mapping Inequality map with the base map, which produced some distortions. The distortion was caused because both of the maps were from different time periods of New Haven, so the city had changed. So, as I added more coordinates to the map, the distortions became more prevalent. 
   
   The map that I created shows the areas of New Haven that suffered from housing inequality. The place of my map is New Haven CT, while the space is the racial and economical separation of living conditions. According to Mapping Inequality, New Haven in the 1930s and 40s had a majority of the housing areas labeled as ‘declining’, with smaller areas labeled as ‘best’, ‘still desirable’, and ‘hazardous’ conditions. The Mapping Inequality project was based on a study done by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC). In her article, Redining in Philadelphia, Amy Hillier discusses the purpose of this study: “In 1935 [...] the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, its parent organization, developed the City Survey Program to investigate economic conditions, real estate trends, and racial and ethnic residential patterns in the nation's largest cities” (Hillier, Redlining in Philadelphia, 2003). For the city of New Haven, the study shows that majority of the city is becoming an undesirable place to live, with the center of the city being mostly’ declining’ areas, while the ‘best’ and ‘still desirable’ areas are on the outskirts of the city. 
   
   The city of New Haven is known to have a mix all types of people from different racial and economic backgrounds. The city is home to a large poor population, and a large population of rich college students. This information leads to very interesting questions about when the housing areas of New Haven started to decline in desirability, and what parts of the city are more impoverished. I used the Social Explorer website in order to answer some of these questions. By selecting the 2015 race information and applying it to the map, it is very clear that the whitest areas of the city are the areas surround the college campuses, specifically Yale University. The majority of the city, outside of these college areas, are predominantly black populations. When comparing the race of the city with the number of families living at or below the poverty line, the poorest communities lineup with the communities with a large black population. By comparing the information gathered from Social Explorer and Mapping Inequality, it is clear that the housing areas labeled as ‘declining’ or ‘hazardous’ line up with the impoverished and colored areas.
   
   My georeferenced map of New Haven, CT can be considered a critique of the area. Michael Crampton states that “a critique is not a project of finding fault, but an examination of the assumptions of a field of knowledge” (Crampton, What is Critique?, 2010). It is commonly assumed the the more an area suffers economically, the more racially diverse the area will be. The map that I have created looks into the legitimacy of this assumption. A problem that arises with looking at the representation of space and place in my map is that the space has changed over the years. As mentioned earlier, the space of my map is the racial and economical separation of living conditions in New Haven, which changes over time. The maps from Mapping Inequality were from the 30s and 40s, so the racial and economic information of the area will certainly be different now. Not only can this map be used to understand the social issues of a particular area, but it can also be used to address housing problems in the future of New Haven. It shows how the area has changed over time with concerns to the livability of certain areas of the city. If information from the coming years were to be added, the map would depict the patterns of change that researchers would then be able to predict.
