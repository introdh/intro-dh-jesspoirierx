## Project 2

   For this project I chose to look at a number of documents from the Classics Quarterly journal. This journal publishes two issues each year, which feature scholarly research papers that are written by historians and philosophers. For this project I looked at nearly three thousand documents from this journal, which were written in the years between 1980 and 2011. Due to the large number of documents used for this project, I wanted to pick a relatively small number of topics so that the data would be condensed enough to be understandable. I chose to have 25 topics, which seems to be the right number for this data set in order to give a wide range of topics that do not overlap. Had I chosen to do a smaller number of topics, they would have been too dense with an unclear theme. If I had chosen to increase the number of topics larger than 25, they would have been too broad and incomprehensible. 
	Based on my Topic Model of the documents from the Classics Quarterly journal, it is clear that there are certain topics related to the field of ancient history that are more popular to write about than others. By referring to my Topic Model, there is a clear trend in the topic of ancient texts for these scholarly journals; 12 of the 25 topics are related to manuscripts, texts, plays, and languages. As a student who studies Classics, this trend is not surprising. All of the ancient texts that historians study were originally written in either Greek or Latin, and then were translated to English. As our understanding of the ancient languages change, scholars must re-evaluate how past intellectuals translated the texts, and what they say about the past societies. The next most common topic for the scholarly articles is politics. This trend is also unsurprising because modern politics were based off of those of the past. So, many scholars would still be studying ancient laws as our current laws change. 
	Topic modelling is a “method of computational linguistics that attempts to find words that frequently appear together within a text and then group them into clusters” (Blevins, Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary, 2010). It offers many possibilities in the understanding of trends in written works. One impressive component of topic modelling processors is that they are “completely unconcerned with the meaning of a word (which is fortunate, given the difficulty of teaching a computer that, in this text, discoarst actually means discoursed). Instead, the program is only concerned with how the words are used in the text, and specifically what words tend to be used similarly” (Blevins, Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary, 2010). This allows the program to match words together into topics that relate to the document they come from, rather than what they mean. 
	Another important aspect of topic modeling is that much can be learned about history by studying the kinds of words in the documents and the ways in which they relate to one another. For example, Cameron Blevins’ topic model of Martha Ballard’s Diary gives the readers an insight into what the typical weather would have been like in the late 18th century; this is the kind of data that would typically not be recorded. Blevins states that “The power of topic modeling really emerges when we examine thematic trends across the entire diary. As a simple barometer of its effectiveness, I used one of the generated topics that I labeled COLD WEATHER, which included words such as cold, windy, chilly, snowy, and air. When its entry scores are aggregated into months of the year, it shows exactly what one would expect over the course of a typical year” (Blevins, Topic Modeling Martha Ballard’s Diary, 2010). This kind of information might have been missed by Blevins had he just read the diary. By creating a topic model and looking at words that just related to cold weather, Blevins was able to see hidden information within the document. 
	One limitation to Topic Modeling is that the topics which are created through a processor are very susceptible to change. By deleting one topic from a topic model, all other topics will be affected. This makes it difficult for the researchers to find the correct number of topics that work best for their projects. Another limitation is that topic modelling “moves scholars away from interpreting language — their great strength — toward interpreting “topics,” an ill-defined act which might provide the false security of having resolved the distinction between a word and the thing that it represents” (Weingart and Meeks, The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling, 2012). Creating the topics is an important part of topic modelling, but the whole point of creating a topic model is to figure out how the words in a set of document relate to one another.
