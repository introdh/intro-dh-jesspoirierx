For this project, I decided to analyze Supreme Court data concerning sexual discrimination in employment. The networks that were created with this data include nodes, which are the ‘stuff’, and edges, which are the relationships (Weingart, Demystifying Networks Parts I &II, 2011). The nodes, or circles, in my network are the supreme court cases relating to sexual discrimination in employment, while the edges, or lines, are the occurrences of reference to another case in order to set precedence. In Supreme Court cases, older cases will be cited in a process called ‘stare decisis,' which is a “legal norm inherited from English common law that encourages judges to follow precedent by letting the past decision stand” (Fowler and Jeon, The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent, 2008). The purpose of this type of network analysis is to “create a measure of case centrality based on citation patterns among U.S. Supreme Court precedents” (Fowler, Johnson, Spriggs, Jeon, and Wahlbeck; Network Analysis and the Law, 2007). 

The networks that I created with the dataset of Supreme Court cases generate many questions and arguments regarding sexual discrimination in employment. The first of these Supreme Court cases came from the 1950’s, while a majority of the cases cited came from the 1970’s and 1980’s. Based on this, an argument can be made that there was an increase in Supreme Court cases concerning sexual discrimination in employment during the 1970’s and 1980’s. According to my networks, there are two cases with the highest centrality from the list of cases pertaining to this issue. These cases are Craig v. Boren from 1976 and Frontiero v. Richardson from 1972. This poses the question as to why these two cases are so popular when setting precedent in Supreme Court cases about sexual discrimination in employment. Interestingly, Craig vs Boren is a case where a male sued due to discrimination based on sex. This is very interesting because a majority of the cases in this dataset are due to females being discriminated against in the workplace. This is an example of the constraints of network analysis, because the networks themselves do not reveal all of the information that the dataset offers. The specific information pertaining to each node in my networks are only visible when the mouse is hovering over the node. Therefore, by just viewing the images that I have included in this project, you will not be able to learn any information about the specific cases that are represented. 

Network analysis has many possibilities and limits when it come to studying data in the digital humanities. Networks “visualize how documents or topics relate to one another” (Weingart, Topic Modeling and Network Analysis, 2011). This is a broad description of the usage of networks, which proves that “pretty much any data can be studied via network analysis” (Weingart, Demystifying Networks Parts I &II, 2011). Due to this, networks are a great tool to use to represent topic models. By creating networks of topic models, “we can see how documents relate to one another, how they relate to topics, how topics are related to each other, and how all of those are related to words” (Weingart, Topic Modeling and Network Analysis, 2011). Networks are most useful when they are created from small datasets. The use of small datasets is a way of “maximizing visibility by minimizing overlap” (Moretti, Network Theory Plot Analysis, 2011). Therefore, a limitation of network analysis is that you cannot use a large dataset. Either the program used to create the network will not work because it “is ill-equipped to deal with multimodal networks,” or the network it creates will be too congested to be understandable (Weingart, Demystifying Networks Parts I &II, 2011). Hopefully in the future algorithms will be created to handle bimodal or multimodal networks. Another limitation of network analysis is that it only reveals a portion of the possible information to be gathered from a data set. Usually, multiple forms of analysis will be performed on datasets in order to get the full picture of information.
