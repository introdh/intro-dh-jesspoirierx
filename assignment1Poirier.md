### Project 1
Jessica Poirier

  As the world is becoming more integrated with technology, people are becoming more and more interested in online entertainment, rather than physical entertainment like books, magazines, etc. YouTube, the video-sharing website, is becoming a very popular form of entertainment. The website provides 24/7, easy access to every YouTube channel and its videos. And, it is a free to use and create website. YouTube provides a platform where creators can become rich and famous through posting videos to their channels. An interesting question concerning this topic is how do these channels become popular? By collecting and examining data about the top 10 most popular channels on YouTube, we can figure out more about how a creator/creators can be successful on this platform. 
  
  With the data from Tables 1 and 2 was can ask and answer the following questions:
  - How often should a creator post videos to become popular?
  - What is the most popular language of YouTube videos?
  - How long should a channel be active before it becomes popular?
  - What is the most popular genre of YouTube Videos?
  - Should channels be created by an individual or group to become popular?
  
  I used Wikipedia, socialblade.com, as well as the individual YouTube Channels listed in Table 1 to gather all of the information for this project.
