# Grant Workshop


## Question/ Abstract

Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

The humanities question guiding my project would be: How can we make archaeological  sites more accessible to students and researchers?

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

Archaeology is a very expensive and time consuming field. Once a site it found, most archaeologists are unable to complete all of the work that they would like to do for their project because of time and money constraints. By creating an interactive digital model of the archaeological site, more students and researchers will have access to the information the site offers at a much cheaper cost. In order to make the digital model as descriptive as possible, there will be collaboration between past archaeologists who have worked on the site so that they can provide all of their findings to be added to the digital model. To create the digital model of the archaeological site, a GIS program will be used. As much information as is available about the site will be added to the project such as: measurements of the site itself, location and description of artifacts found, the temperature of the area the site is located in, what kind of materials make up the ground of the site, etc. By the end of this project, a digital model of an archaeological site will have been created that will be a replica of the physical site. 

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in 







## Peer Review


In your group, share your question(s)/ abstract and answer the following questions:

- Is there a clear humanities question guiding the project? 
- Can the humanities question being posed be addressed by the outlined abstract?
- Is the question and/or abstract too vague or too broad?
- Where would the data come from? Does it need to be created? Potential sources?
- Could this project be accomplished in 1-2 years?
- Is there a similar project already in process?
