### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
### What is Distant Reading by Kathryn Schultz:

In this reading, the following passage clarified for me the problems that modern researchers of literature face when trying to make generalizations of texts: 
<dl>
<dd>“Let’s say you pick up a copy of “Jude the Obscure,” become obsessed with Victorian fiction and somehow manage to make your way through all 200-odd books generally considered part of that canon. Moretti would say: So what? As many as 60,000 other novels were published in 19th-century England — to mention nothing of other times and places. You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small. Since no feasible amount of reading can fix that, what’s called for is a change not in scale but in strategy. To understand literature, Moretti argues, we must stop reading books”.</dd>
</dl>
The following quote did not make much sense to me:
<dl>
<dd>“By the end, even Moretti concedes that things didn’t unfold as planned. Somewhere along the line, he writes, he “drifted from quantification to the qualitative analysis of plot”.</dd>
</dl>
This quote was confusing to me because I am unsure of what exactly Moretti’s plan was in the first place, or why it did not work out. I need further explanation of what the goal of Moretti’s research was. Also, I do not know what quantification or qualitative analysis is. 

### Macroanalysis by Matthew Jockers:

The following passage was clarifying for me:
<dl>
<dd>“It would be wasteful and futile to debate the value of interpretation, but interpretation is fueled by observation, and as a method of evidence gathering, observation—both in the sciences and in the humanities—is flawed. Despite all their efforts to repress them, researchers will have irrepressible biases. Even scientists will “interpret” their evidence through a lens of subjectivity. Observation is flawed in the same way that generalization from the specific is flawed: the generalization may be good, it may even explain a total population, but the selection of the sample is always something less than perfect, and so the observed results are likewise imperfect” (p.6-7).</dd>
</dl>
In the ‘Data before the Fact’ reading by Daniel Rosenberg we read that data and evidence mean different things because evidence is fact and data is not. This was confusing to me because I have always known data to be observations of the world, so how could that not be fact? I did not consider that there could be bias in the collection of said data.

The following passage requires further explanation:
<dl>
<dd>“We are proficient at electronic search and comfortable searching digital collections for some piece of evidence to support an argument, but the sheer amount of data now available makes search ineffectual as a means of evidence gathering. Close reading, digital searching, will continue to reveal nuggets, while the deeper veins lie buried beneath the mass of gravel layered above. What are required are methods for aggregating and making sense out of both the nuggets and the tailings” (p.9). “We must evolve to embrace new approaches and new methodologies designed for accessing and leveraging the electronic texts that make up the twenty-first-century digital library” (p.10).</dd>
</dl>
I am not completely sure what it is that we are trying to figure out about literature that we need these new methods for. What new methods are there that we could use?

### Graphs, Maps, Trees by Franco Moretti:

The following passage provided a very interesting perspective on why novels lose popularity over time:
<dl>
<dd>“And the reason behind the downturns seems to be always the same: politics - a direct, virulent censorship during the Kansei and Tempo periods, and an indirect influence in the years leading up to the Meiji Restoration, when there was no specific repression of the book trade, and the crisis was thus probably due to a more general dissonance between the rhythm of political crises and the writing of novels” (p.9).</dd>
</dl>
I was thinking more generally that people must have just lost interest in reading certain genres of books. However, it makes sense that a tumultuous event in society would affect not only people’s interest in reading certain kinds of novels, but also the writer’s interest in writing such novels. 

I found the following quotes confusing:
<dl>
<dd>As more and more novels are written, “the popularity of old books suddenly collapses, and novelistic audiences turn resolutely (and irreversibly) towards the current season” (p.8). </dd>

<dd>“Books survive if they are read and disappear if they aren’t: and when an entire generic system vanishes at once, the likeliest explanation is that its readers vanished at once” (p.20).</dd>
</dl>
How is the decrease of interest in classic novels irreversible? If the writing of novels fluxuates, wouldn’t people read the old texts more often during the decrease in the writing of novels? Moretti talks a lot about cycles or patterns that the writing of books follows, so how can a portion of this cycle be irreversible, yet the cycle itself can still repeat itself?
