### 2017-09-18: Distant reading
### What is Distant Reading by Kathryn Schultz:

In this reading, the following passage clarified for me the problems that modern researchers of literature face when trying to make generalizations of texts: 
<dl>
<dd>“Let’s say you pick up a copy of “Jude the Obscure,” become obsessed with Victorian fiction and somehow manage to make your way through all 200-odd books generally considered part of that canon. Moretti would say: So what? As many as 60,000 other novels were published in 19th-century England — to mention nothing of other times and places. You might know your George Eliot from your George Meredith, but you won’t have learned anything meaningful about literature, because your sample size is absurdly small. Since no feasible amount of reading can fix that, what’s called for is a change not in scale but in strategy. To understand literature, Moretti argues, we must stop reading books”.</dd>
</dl>
The following quote did not make much sense to me:
<dl>
<dd>“By the end, even Moretti concedes that things didn’t unfold as planned. Somewhere along the line, he writes, he “drifted from quantification to the qualitative analysis of plot”.</dd>
</dl>
This quote was confusing to me because I am unsure of what exactly Moretti’s plan was in the first place, or why it did not work out. I need further explanation of what the goal of Moretti’s research was. Also, I do not know what quantification or qualitative analysis is. 

### Macroanalysis by Matthew Jockers:

The following passage was clarifying for me:
<dl>
<dd>“It would be wasteful and futile to debate the value of interpretation, but interpretation is fueled by observation, and as a method of evidence gathering, observation—both in the sciences and in the humanities—is flawed. Despite all their efforts to repress them, researchers will have irrepressible biases. Even scientists will “interpret” their evidence through a lens of subjectivity. Observation is flawed in the same way that generalization from the specific is flawed: the generalization may be good, it may even explain a total population, but the selection of the sample is always something less than perfect, and so the observed results are likewise imperfect” (p.6-7).</dd>
</dl>
In the ‘Data before the Fact’ reading by Daniel Rosenberg we read that data and evidence mean different things because evidence is fact and data is not. This was confusing to me because I have always known data to be observations of the world, so how could that not be fact? I did not consider that there could be bias in the collection of said data.

The following passage requires further explanation:
<dl>
<dd>“We are proficient at electronic search and comfortable searching digital collections for some piece of evidence to support an argument, but the sheer amount of data now available makes search ineffectual as a means of evidence gathering. Close reading, digital searching, will continue to reveal nuggets, while the deeper veins lie buried beneath the mass of gravel layered above. What are required are methods for aggregating and making sense out of both the nuggets and the tailings” (p.9). “We must evolve to embrace new approaches and new methodologies designed for accessing and leveraging the electronic texts that make up the twenty-first-century digital library” (p.10).</dd>
</dl>
I am not completely sure what it is that we are trying to figure out about literature that we need these new methods for. What new methods are there that we could use?

### Graphs, Maps, Trees by Franco Moretti:

The following passage provided a very interesting perspective on why novels lose popularity over time:
<dl>
<dd>“And the reason behind the downturns seems to be always the same: politics - a direct, virulent censorship during the Kansei and Tempo periods, and an indirect influence in the years leading up to the Meiji Restoration, when there was no specific repression of the book trade, and the crisis was thus probably due to a more general dissonance between the rhythm of political crises and the writing of novels” (p.9).</dd>
</dl>
I was thinking more generally that people must have just lost interest in reading certain genres of books. However, it makes sense that a tumultuous event in society would affect not only people’s interest in reading certain kinds of novels, but also the writer’s interest in writing such novels. 

I found the following quotes confusing:
<dl>
<dd>As more and more novels are written, “the popularity of old books suddenly collapses, and novelistic audiences turn resolutely (and irreversibly) towards the current season” (p.8). </dd>

<dd>“Books survive if they are read and disappear if they aren’t: and when an entire generic system vanishes at once, the likeliest explanation is that its readers vanished at once” (p.20).</dd>
</dl>
How is the decrease of interest in classic novels irreversible? If the writing of novels fluxuates, wouldn’t people read the old texts more often during the decrease in the writing of novels? Moretti talks a lot about cycles or patterns that the writing of books follows, so how can a portion of this cycle be irreversible, yet the cycle itself can still repeat itself?

### 2017-09-25: Topic modeling I
### Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction by Megan R. Brett
The following quote was clarifying on the usage of Topic Modeling:
<dl>
 <dd>"If you wanted to topic model one fairly short document, you might be better off with a set of highlighters or a good pdf annotation tool. Topic modeling is built for large collections of texts" </dd>
 </dl>
 This quote made a lot of sense to me. You want to get an understanding of word groups, or topics, in a large sense, so using a small set of documents would not be very helpful.
 
 I found the following quote to be suprising:
 <dl>
 <dd>"The people behind Paper Machines, a tool which allows you to topic model your Zotero library, recommend that you have at least 1,000 items in the library or collection you want to model. The question of “how big” or “how small” is ultimately subjective, but I think you want to have at least in the hundreds if not a minimum of 1,000 documents in your corpus.”</dd>
 </dl>
 I did not imagine that this process would take so many documents. Thinking about it after reading this text, it makes sense why a researcher would need such a huge corpus, but it makes me wonder how long this process takes?
 
### The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling by Scott B. Weingart and Elijah Meeks
I found the following quote clarifying:
<dl>
 <dd>"Just as tools are enshrined methodologies, methods like topic modeling are reflections of movements." </dd>
 </dl>
Researchers use different methods of topic modeling to find patterns of words groups, or topics. They can compare these topics with documents for a range of years to see how often the words were used, and when they were not.

I found the following quote to be confusing:
<dl>
 <dd>"The result is a call for caution in the use of topic modeling because it moves scholars away from interpreting language — their great strength — toward interpreting “topics,” an ill-defined act which might provide the false security of having resolved the distinction between a word and the thing that it represents" </dd>
 </dl>
 I thought topics were word groups that co-occur in pieces of literature, so how could interpreting topics not be a form of interpretting language?
 
 ### Text Analysis of Marth Ballard's Diary by Cameron Blevins
 I found the following quote to be very interesting:
 <dl>
 <dd>"The first basic step for performing a more detailed text analysis of Martha Ballard’s diary was to begin cleaning up the data. One step was to take all the words and (temporarily) turn every uppercase letter into a lowercase letter. This kept Python from seeing “Birth” and “birth” as two separate words. For the purposes of this particular program, it was more important to distill words into a basic unit rather than maintain the complexity of capitalized characters".</dd>
 </dl>
 As a student who has never studied anything like markdonw files before taking this class, I found it interesting to learn that having a capital letter could make the program read the same word as two words. Again, I wonder how long the process of topic modeling takes, considering the amount of editing that goes into the documents.
 
 The only part of this article that I found confusing is the following quote:
 <dl>
 <dd>"The list allows us to access pieces of information by “calling” their position. It helped me to think of the entire diary list as a warehouse containing almost 10,000 boxes (entries) inside it, with each box containing five compartments, with the first of those compartments divided into three sub-compartments. If you were to open any of the boxes (entries) and look inside the first compartment, then inside sub-compartment number two, you would always find a number that represented the month of that particular entry. If you were to look inside the third compartment of the entry/box, you would always find the main text for that day’s entry". </dd>
 </dl>
 Here, the author was trying to explain a confusing concept with, to me at least, and even more confusing example. 
 
 ### What can Topic Models of PMLA Teach Us About the History of Literary Scholarship by Ted Underwood and Andrew Goldstone
 I found the following quote to be clarifying:
 <dl>
 <dd>"The strictly linguistic character of this technique is a limitation as well as a strength: it’s not designed to reveal motivation or conflict". </dd>
 </dl>
This makes sense. Topic modeling only shows you the info pertaining to the topic. It is up to the researcher to figure out why the words of the topic were used or how the meaning of those words changed over time. 

I found the following quote to be interesting, considering our last lab in class:
<dl>
 <dd>"Since common words are often difficult to interpret, it can be tempting to exclude them from the modeling process. It’s true that a word like “the” isn’t likely to reveal much. But subtle, interesting rhetorical habits can be encoded in common words. (E.g. “itself” is especially common in late-20th century theoretical topics.)" </dd>
 </dl>
 In lab during our last lab we practiced using a program where we took stopwords out of documents, so that we could focus on the more important words. It isinteresting to see how the simple words that we would be quick to remove from a docuemtn could tell us a lot of the language and changes in that word.


### 2017-10-02: Topic Modeling II

### Mining the Dispatch:
I found the following quote to be clarifying:
<dl>
 <dd>“Conventional historical methods would involve skimming much of this and closely reading a small sampling of articles. That method has much to recommend it, and topic modeling is certainly not a replacement for conventional, close reading methods. It and other distant reading methods do, however, provides historians an additional method that allows us to examine and detect patterns within not a sampling but in the entirety of an archive.” </dd>
 </dl>
 A researcher has to first decide what they want to study about a set of texts. It their purpose can be acheived by skimming, or taking a small sample, they will use a close reading technique. If the project requires looking at a large set of texts to get the full picture, topic modeling can be used as a way to examine all of the texts.
 
 
 I did not find anything confusing or needing further explanation in this digital project. The author does a great job of explaining all confusing terms he used, and how he went about completing his project. 
 
 ### Signs at 40:
 I found the following quote to be clarifying:
 <dl>
 <dd>“In almost any algorithmically generated topic model, no matter how carefully prepared, some topics prove difficult to interpret meaningfully. Common words with flexible meanings are not always handled well by the modeling process, and as a result there are certain topics in our model that we have found to be more confusing than enlightening for exploring the Signs archive. We have hidden these, so that of the 70 topics only 67 are normally included in the listings and visualizations here.” </dd>
 </dl>
If a researcher is publishing a digital project, they would want it to be as clear and understandable by their audience as possible. It makes sense that they would leave out any topics that they themselves did not understand, or thought were irrevant.


The following quote needs further explanation:
<dl>
 <dd>“The algorithmic nature of the technique does not mean the model presented here is free of interpretation. The major interpretive choice is, of course, the decision to offer the model in the first place. But other, technical choices are interpretive as well. The algorithm requires the user to specify the number of topics in advance; we have settled on 70 topics as yielding a suggestive and interesting model of our archive. We have also not taken every page of Signs into consideration; we have limited ourselves to articles (rather than reviews) and we have excluded short texts (those under 800 words). We have omitted from consideration a list of stop words (including very common words like the and and, personal names, and certain terms common to article reference lists) which distort the modeling results. The same applies to very rare words; we have also omitted words occurring four or fewer times in the whole corpus. Though it would be possible to combine morphologically related words, we have decided it is worth preserving the different verbal associations of, for example, woman and women.” </dd>
 </dl>
 Why would the researchers leave out the short texts? The point of this digital project is to see how the Signs changed over time. Wouldn’t all articles, short or long, have important information to offer?
 
### Text Analysis of Trump’s Tweets Confirms He Writes Only the (Angrier) Andriod Half by David Robinson:
I found that the following quote is very clear:
<dl>
 <dd>“Another place we can spot a difference is in Trump’s anachronistic behavior of “manually retweeting” people by copy-pasting their tweets, then surrounding them with quotation marks. In the remaining by-word analyses in this text, I’ll filter these quoted tweets out (since they contain text from followers that may not be representative of Trump’s own tweets).” </dd>
 </dl>
 It makes sense that the author would do this. He is trying to figure out which tweets are written by Trump, so analyzing words from his followers would not provide any helpful information.
 
 I found that the following quote needs further explanation:
 <dl>
 <dd>“Others have explored Trump’s timeline and noticed this tends to hold up- and Trump himself does indeed tweet from a Samsung Galaxy. But how could we examine it quantitatively? I’ve been writing about text mining and sentiment analysisrecently, particularly during my development of the tidytext R package with Julia Silge, and this is a great opportunity to apply it again.”</dd>
 </dl>
 The author does not explain what sentiment analysis is, or how he plans to apply it to Trump’s Tweets.
 
### Data Miners Dig for answers about Harper Lee, Truman Capote and ‘Go Set a Watchman’ by Ellen Gamerman:
I found the following quote to be very clear:
<dl>
 <dd>“At the climax of ‘Mockingbird’, Ms. Lee’s voice as a writer is less distinct than at any other point in the novel, the researchers said. Here, near the end of the book, when Scout and her brother Jem are attacked and the racist villani Bob Ewell is killed with a kitchen knife, Ms. Lee’s writing style has more in common with Mr. Capote’s than her own, they said. The academics reached this conclusion by comparing sections of ‘Mockingbird’ with two of Mr. Capote’s works, ‘In Cold Blood’ and ‘The Grass Harp’.” </dd>
 </dl>
The researchers compared the three works to discern that either Capote wrote ‘Mockingbird’, or he heavily influenced Ms. Lee in her writing style. They were able to figure this out by studying the types of words the authors used, and the way in which they used them.
 
 
I found the following quote to be confusing:
<dl>
 <dd>“The findings, which attempt to shed light on a book that has sparked world­wide attention by an author who has famously declined to discuss her work, show Ms. Lee as the undisputed author of both novels but suggest that her style as a writer was more consistent in “Watchman” than ‘Mockingbird.’” </dd>
 </dl>
 This is confusing because later in the article the researchers claim that they hold the unpopular belief that Capote actually wrote ‘Mockingbird’. Why do they also say that she was the undisputed author of both novels?

### 2017-10-09: Stylometry

### 2017-10-18: Spatial history

### 2017-10-23: Mapping: A Critical Introduction
### Beyond GIS: Geospatial Technologies and the Future of History by David Bodenhamer:
The following quote is clarifying:
<dl>
 <dd> “Distance-collapsing innovations - the telephone, wireless telegraph, radio, cinema, automobiles, and airplanes, among others - challenged traditional understanding of how time and space intersected with the social world. It suddenly was possible to know events as they occurred, and this experience of simultaneity refashioned people’s sense of distance and direction. It also meant that individuals were no longer cut off from the flow of time: widely available film and photographic images made the past as accessible as the present.” (p.1).</dd>
 </dl>
 This makes it easier to understand what the author means by spatial history.
 
 I did not find anything confusing about this article. 
 
 ### What is spatial history by Richard White:
 I found the following quote to be very clear:
 <dl>
 <dd> “These projects are open-ended: everything —both tools and data— becomes part of a scholarly commons to be added to, subtracted from, reworked and recombined.” </dd>
 </dl>
 This quote make sense to me; as more data is found, it should be added to the existing project so that another updated one does not have to be created.
 
 The following quote was confusing:
 <dl>
 <dd> “Henri Lefebvre’s The Production of Space introduced a generation of historians to the idea that space is neither simply natural geography nor an empty container filled by history. It is rather something that human beings produce over time. Spatial relations shift and change. Space is itself historical. Lefebvre, who was a philosopher and not a geographer, organized his own work around three forms of space that he called spatial practice, representations of space, and representational space” </dd>
 </dl>
 I found this quote to be confusing because I do not understand how space is something that humans create over time. 
 
 ### A Data Model for Spatial History by Evgenia Shnayder:
 I found the following quote to be clear:
 <dl>
 <dd> “Without GIS and computers, no researcher could readily analyze freight tables without spending months manually mapping the station locations and calculating costs among the different stations.” </dd>
 </dl>
 This makes sense. Modern technology has greatly advanced the effectivness of research.
 
 The following quote needs further explanation:
 <dl>
 <dd> “We recognize that having many researchers work on the same data can lead to a vast array of ideas and approaches at best, and at worst, to chaos and disorganization. The Western Railroads Geodatabase allows us to set accessibility limits for internal or external researchers so that there is a level of accountability and quality control at the project's core.” </dd>
 </dl>
 I do not understand how having more researchers could be bad for the database. In the conclusion, the author even asks for more researchers to contribute to the project.
 
 ### Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS by Jeremy Crampton:
 The following quote was clarifying:
 <dl>
 <dd> “The point them is not that long ago there was something called map making (which is now called geospatial technology or GIS) but rather that the understanding of what people thought they were doing with things they called maps has changed over time, as well as over space” (p.3). </dd>
 </dl>
 When I began to read this article I was confused about what the author meant by 'cartographer', so this quote was very clarifying about the change in the meaning of the word. 
 
 I found the following quote to be confusing:
 <dl>
 <dd> Joe Painter’s quote: “I love maps. There, I’ve said it. I am coming out as a cartophile. Although I became fascinated by maps when I was a child maps have figured little in my work as an academic geographer. I suspect that many human geographers who learned this trade in the postpositivist 1980s, as I did, shared my mild embarrassment about maps” (p. 6). </dd>
 </dl>
 How could geographers not use maps in their job? And what were the postpositivist 1980s?
